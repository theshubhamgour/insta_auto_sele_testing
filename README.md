# Project Title: Automatic Instagram Login and Skip Not Now

Description:
This Python script allows you to automate the process of logging into Instagram and skipping the "Not Now" prompt for saving login information and notification settings. It uses the Selenium library to interact with the Instagram login page, enters your username and password, and clicks the login button. Then it automatically clicks the "Not Now" buttons for saving login information and notification settings, so you can quickly access your Instagram account without any interruptions.
